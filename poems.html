<h3>Those Days</h3>
<p>All the birds flew away,<br>
Bowling as I watch 'em go<br>
The empty nests the still domain, no I can't take it anymore.<br>
The birds weren't pretty anyway, But atleast they came on the way<br>
With their Wings, they would hide, All the dark bitter side.<br>
Now the birds are long gone,<br>
I am here all alone,<br>
With no one beside me to meet,<br>
On the path I put my feet.</p>

<h3>Double Dice</h3>
<p>I rolled the dice, Not once but twice.<br>
The first was light,<br>
It told me lies.<br>
The second fell, But made no sound.<br>
A door was there, No walls around.</p>

<h3>Double Dice pt.2</h3>
<p>I rolled the dice, Not once but twice. One kissed the flame, A whisper bled,<br>
One slept in ice.<br>
A silence spoke.<br>
The game was rigged<br>
Yet still, I woke.</p>

<h3>Desires</h3>
<p>Dangerous desires dance,<br>
Draped in dusk,<br>
Shadows' sinister song<br>
Silences Trust...<br>
Is it passion, or poison art? A dangerous thief of soul & heart.</p>
