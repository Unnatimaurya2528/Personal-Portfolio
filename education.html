<h1>Education</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>KG & Early Years:</strong> The Eden Public School, Adalhat, Mirzapur — Kindergarten foundation years. Early learning emphasized play, curiosity, and basic social skills.</li>
  <li><strong>Class 1 – 10:</strong> Sunbeam School Robertsganj, Sonbhadra — Primary & middle schooling where I participated in events, built reading habits, and developed stage confidence, art & sports interest, and teamwork.</li>
  <li><strong>Class 11 (PCB):</strong> Sunbeam School Robertsganj — Current studies in Physics, Chemistry, Biology. This stage focuses on academic goals and prepares me for competitive tests and project work (BNAT qualified; ASSET cleared).</li>
