<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Unnati Maurya, a curious, imaginative, and determined 16-year-old currently studying in Class 11 (PCB) at Sunbeam School Robertsganj. My learning journey has been shaped not only by academics but also by a wide spectrum of experiences that constantly push me to grow—debates that sharpen my logic, stage performances that strengthen my confidence, and story-writing competitions that allow my creativity to breathe freely. Every event I participate in becomes a stepping stone, helping me evolve into someone who can communicate clearly, think deeply, and express ideas with both clarity and emotion.</p>
<p>I have always found comfort and inspiration in the world of books—whether it's fiction that paints new universes or general knowledge that reveals the hidden wonders of the real one. Writing stories and poems is my personal way of exploring thoughts, emotions, and possibilities; words feel like threads, and I love weaving them into meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>Recently, I stepped into the dynamic world of web development. For me, coding is more than a skill—it's a beautiful fusion of creativity and logic. Watching an idea transform into a living, interactive webpage feels almost magical. Every project I build teaches me something new, and the process inspires me to imagine bigger, bolder digital creations.</p>
<p>I am deeply passionate about storytelling and public speaking, two art forms that help me connect with people, share perspectives, and express myself with confidence and empathy. These skills have taught me that ideas gain power when communicated well.</p>
<p>My short-term goals revolve around strengthening my academics, refining my understanding of science, and completing impactful digital projects that reflect both creativity and precision.</p>
<p>In the long run, I envision myself growing into an entrepreneur—someone who leads with innovation, discipline, and compassion. I aspire to build ideas that matter, create solutions that inspire, and carve a path where imagination and hard work walk side by side.</p>
